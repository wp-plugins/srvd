Use Srvd to show targeted content to visitors or redirect them to another page based on their location and browsing settings.

== Description ==

Srvd is a simple tool that allows people show different content to each website visitor based on their location and browsing settings. Showing content tailored to each visitors settings means they get the most relevant experience. The more relevant you make your website for each visitor the more likely they are to interact with it and convert into a lead or paying customer.

This plugin lets you easily add your Srvd placements to your Wordpress website. Once installed you will get a Srvd logo on your WYSIWYG Wordpress page editor where you can choose the placement to add.

This plugin also adds the main Srvd code to every page of your Wordpress site which means creating redirects within Srvd will instantly become active on your Wordpress website.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
